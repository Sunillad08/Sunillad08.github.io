**Learning web development by doing this introduction project.**

I am learning very basic Responsive web designing with html and css (& little bit js) only (without any frameworks) to test my basic knowledge I just learned! I have built my portfolio site , I know it doesn't look that great but I am happy that I started and completed this :)
